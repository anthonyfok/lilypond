@cindex percussion
@cindex drums

@funindex \drummode
@funindex \drums

Percussion notes may be entered in @code{\drummode} mode, which is
similar to the standard mode for entering notes.  The simplest way
to enter percussion notes is to use the @code{\drums} command,
which creates the correct context and entry mode for percussion:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\drums {
  hihat4 hh bassdrum bd
}
@end lilypond

This is shorthand for:

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\new DrumStaff \drummode {
  hihat4 hh bassdrum bd
}
@end lilypond

Each piece of percussion has a full name and an abbreviated name,
and both can be used in input files.  The full list of percussion
note names may be found in @ref{Percussion notes}.

@cindex clef, percussion
@cindex percussion clef

Note that the normal notation of pitches (such as @code{cis4}) in a
@code{DrumStaff} context will cause an error message.  Percussion clefs
are added automatically to a @code{DrumStaff} context but they can also
be set explicitly.  Other clefs may be used as well.

@lilypond[quote,ragged-right,verbatim]
\drums {
  \clef percussion
  bd4 4 4 4
  \clef treble
  hh4 4 4 4
}
@end lilypond


There are a few issues concerning MIDI support for percussion
instruments; for details please see @ref{Creating MIDI output}.

@node Drum rolls
@unnumberedsubsubsec Drum rolls

Drum rolls are indicated with three slashes across the stem.  For
quarter notes or longer the three slashes are shown explicitly,
eighth notes are shown with two slashes (the beam being the
third), and drum rolls shorter than eighths have one stem slash to
supplement the beams.  This is achieved with the tremolo notation,
as described in @ref{Tremolo repeats}.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\drums {
  \time 2/4
  sn16 8 16 8 8:32 ~
  8 8 4:32 ~
  4 8 16 16
  4 r4
}
@end lilypond

Sticking can be indicated by placing a markup for @code{"R"}
or @code{"L"} above or below notes, as discussed in
@ref{Direction and placement}.  The @code{staff-padding} property
may be overridden to achieve a pleasing baseline.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\drums {
  \repeat unfold 2 {
    sn16^"L" 16^"R" 16^"L" 16^"L" 16^"R" 16^"L" 16^"R" 16^"R"

@node Pitched percussion
@unnumberedsubsubsec Pitched percussion

Certain pitched percussion instruments (e.g., xylophone,
vibraphone, and timpani) are written using normal staves.
This is covered in other sections of the manual.

@node Percussion staves
@unnumberedsubsubsec Percussion staves

@cindex percussion
@cindex drums

A percussion part for more than one instrument typically uses a
multiline staff where each position in the staff refers to one
piece of percussion.  To typeset the music, the notes must be
interpreted in @code{DrumStaff} and @code{DrumVoice} context.

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
up = \drummode {
  crashcymbal4 hihat8 halfopenhihat hh hh hh openhihat
}
down = \drummode {
  bassdrum4 snare8 bd r bd sn4
}
\new DrumStaff <<
  \new DrumVoice { \voiceOne \up }
  \new DrumVoice { \voiceTwo \down }
>>
@end lilypond

The above example shows verbose polyphonic notation.  The short
polyphonic notation, described in @rlearning{I'm hearing Voices},
can also be used.
For example,

@lilypond[quote,verbatim]
\new DrumStaff <<
  \drummode {
    bd4 sn4 bd4 sn4
    << {
      \repeat unfold 16 hh16
    } \\ {
      bd4 sn4 bd4 sn4
    } >>
  }
>>
@end lilypond

There are also other layout possibilities.  To use these, set the
property @code{drumStyleTable} in context @code{DrumVoice}.  The
following variables have been predefined:

@c TODO: decide what to do about this table.  (ie verbatim or not)
@table @code

@item drums-style
This is the default.  It typesets a typical drum kit on a
five-line staff:

@lilypond[quote,line-width=10.0\cm]
nam = \lyricmode {
  cymc cyms cymr hh hhc hho hhho hhp
  cb hc bd sn ss tomh tommh tomml toml tomfh tomfl }
mus = \drummode {
  cymc cyms cymr hh hhc hho hhho hhp \break
  cb hc bd sn ss tomh tommh tomml toml tomfh tomfl s16 }
\score {
  << \new DrumStaff \with {
       \remove "Bar_engraver"
       \remove "Time_signature_engraver"
       \hide Stem
       \override Stem.Y-extent = ##f
     } \mus
     \new Lyrics \nam
  >>
  \layout {
    \context {
      \Score
      \override LyricText.font-family = #'typewriter
      \override BarNumber.transparent =##T
    }
  }
}
@end lilypond

The drum scheme supports six different toms.  When there are fewer
toms, simply select the toms that produce the desired result.  For
example, to get toms on the three middle lines you use
@code{tommh}, @code{tomml}, and @code{tomfh}.

@item agostini-drums-style
Invented by the French percussionist Dante Agostini in 1965, this notation is
commonly employed in France but also elsewhere.

@lilypond[quote,line-width=10.0\cm]

  cb hc bd sn ss tomh tommh tomml toml tomfh tomfl }
